Submission Date: 1st September 2019

This assignment was a part of my acedemics.

Java SE 8.0 and JavaFX used to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the CityLodge rental room management.

Features :

Add Room: The user (an employee of CityLodge) selects this option to create a new standard room or a suite. The user can enter all relevant details of a new room, such as room id, room type, number of bed rooms and last maintenance date if the room is a suite. When a room is first created, it's status is Available.

Rent Room: By selecting this option, an employee of CityLodge can then enter a standard room ID or suite ID and enter relevant information for a customer to rent that room.

Return Room: By selecting this option, an employee of CityLodge can then enter a room or suite ID and a return date to return that room. If a return is successful, your program should print all relevant information about that room, including information about the latest hiring record.

Room Maintenance: By selecting this option, an employee of CityLodge can then enter a room or suite ID to put that room under maintenance.

Complete Maintenance: By selecting this option, an employee of CityLodge can then enter a room or suite ID to complete maintenance of that room. From the ID, if the room is a suite, then the system will prompt the employee to enter a maintenance completion date. If the room is a standard room, no need to enter the maintenance completion date.

Display All Rooms: By selecting this option, an employee of CityLodge can see on the Console all information about all rental rooms stored in the system, including details about up to 10 most recent hiring records of each room.
